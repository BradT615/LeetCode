# LeetCode

Welcome to my collection of solutions for LeetCode problems. This repository is a compilation of my approaches to solving various algorithmic challenges posed by LeetCode.

## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. The problems range from easy to hard and cover a variety of topics from data structures, algorithms, and logic. This repository serves as a personal documentation of my journey through these problems, showcasing my solutions and thought processes.

## Repository Structure

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem. Inside each directory, you'll find at least two files:

- A `.py` file containing the Python solution.
- A `README.md` file explaining the problem and the approach used to solve it.

## Usage

To use this repository, you can clone it to your local machine or browse the solutions on GitHub. Each problem's directory contains a README with a link to the problem statement on LeetCode, so you can understand the context before diving into the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BradT615/LeetCode.git
cd LeetCode
```
